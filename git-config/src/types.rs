///

/// "last one wins".

/// of `b`, `c`, and `d`, while `e` is a single variable with the value
/// `f g h`.

/// ```text
/// [core]
///     a = b
///     a = c
/// [core]
///     a = d
///     e = f g h
/// ```
///
/// Calling methods that fetch or set only one value (such as [`raw_value()`])
/// key `a` with the above config will fetch `d` or replace `d`, since the last
/// valid config key/value pair is `a = d`:
///
/// # Filtering
///
/// All methods exist in a `*_filter(â€¦, filter)` version to allow skipping sections by
/// their metadata. That way it's possible to select values based on their `git_sec::Trust`
/// for example, or by their location.
///
/// Note that the filter may be executed even on sections that don't contain the key in question,
/// even though the section will have matched the `name` and `subsection_name` respectively.
///
/// ```

/// # use std::convert::TryFrom;

/// assert_eq!(git_config.raw_value("core", None, "a").unwrap().as_ref(), "d");
/// ```
///
/// Consider the `multi` variants of the methods instead, if you want to work
/// with all values.
///

///
/// In order to make it useful, equality will ignore all non-value bearing information, hence compare
/// only sections and their names, as well as all of their values. The ordering matters, of course.
