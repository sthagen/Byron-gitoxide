## 0.9.5 (2022-06-13)

### New Features

 - <csr-id-652f228bb7ec880856d4e6ee1c171b0b85a735e2/> expose `Prefix::MIN_HEX_LEN`.
   That way other crates can know which candidates to discard off the bat
   instead of having to match on an error. It's mere convenience.

<csr-id-3373946d27c91169172e62a637a305ef1e5fbb9e/>

 - <csr-id-79dc0d5ba6fa31ddd5c075693ffdc6496c1eaded/> rename `oid::try_from()` to `try_from_bytes()`, add `from_bytes_unchecked()`
   This change was done in the name of consistency, as `from_bytes()` is
   used in many other git-* crates
 - <csr-id-1b75541c00b8a18000336a8a7eceae5beba1058d/> Remove `Kind:Efrom_len_in_bytes()` from public API
   It shouldn't be encouraged to assume the hash can be deduced from its
   length, also git doesn't assume this.
   
   If that would happen, we would have other problems though, so let's hope
   it doesn't happen nonetheless.
 - <csr-id-b12ee8a97904e6e90b6c08ad9e6804ee969bff41/> Remove `ObjectId::null_sha1()` from public API
   Use `Kind::Sha1.null()` instead if it's a value where the actual

   throughout the git-* crates thus far.

 - <csr-id-2a799e662aa172c243b54d1df0dfc78501cb024f/> remove `ObjectId::from_20_bytes()` from public API
   Use `ObjectId::from()` or `ObjectId::try_from()` instead.
 - <csr-id-53c748d7f438f57e8119cdf04402bfeaa9f2a286/> remove various SHA1 specific hex utilities in favor of unspecific new ones
   - removed `to_sha1_hex()`, use `oid::hex_to_buf()` and
   `oid::hex_to_buf()` instead.

   This makes reading and writing the hash number easier for newer file
   formats.

 - <csr-id-9a0d8b810050f2acabca988c5ab24ebe93a5d260/> `Kind::len_in_bytes()` method
   It yields the amount of bytes needed to store the hash.

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-d2e2ea0a9b9c5f756d8b02b4872e6950faa03b3e/> don't use panicking const fn just yet to not require rust 1.57
