# Security process documents

> [!NOTE]
> To *report* a vulnerability, see the [**security policy**](https://github.com/GitoxideLabs/gitoxide/security/policy), which can also be read in the top-level [`SECURITY.md`](https://github.com/GitoxideLabs/gitoxide/blob/main/SECURITY.md).

## Table of Contents

The documents in this directory are things we use when managing vulnerabilities:

### Incident Response Plan

- [*`irp.md`*](irp.md) is our incident response plan.

### Threat Model

- [*`threat-model.md`*](threat-model.md) is our provisional threat model outline.

- [*`threat-model-notes.md`*](threat-model-notes.md) are some notes in a different form that have informed it. It overlaps significantly with `threat-model.md`, but it may also occasionally be useful to refer to.
