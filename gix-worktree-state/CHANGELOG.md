## 0.1.0 (2023-08-22)

<csr-id-93feea269eebd114e866e6f29f4a73c0096df9e0/>

### Chore

 - <csr-id-93feea269eebd114e866e6f29f4a73c0096df9e0/> split tests off into their own crate to allow feature toggles.
   That way we can test with the `parallel` feature and won't have to
   create bogus feature toggles that are only used for testing, yet visbible
   to users.

### New Features
