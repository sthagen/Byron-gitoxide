## 0.8.1 (2023-12-30)

<csr-id-3bd09ef120945a9669321ea856db4079a5dab930/>

### Chore

- <csr-id-3bd09ef120945a9669321ea856db4079a5dab930/> change `rust-version` manifest field back to 1.65.
  They didn't actually need to be higher to work, and changing them
  unecessarily can break downstream CI.

  Let's keep this value as low as possible, and only increase it when
  more recent features are actually used.

## 0.8.0 (2023-12-29)

<csr-id-aea89c3ad52f1a800abb620e9a4701bdf904ff7d/>

### Chore

- <csr-id-aea89c3ad52f1a800abb620e9a4701bdf904ff7d/> upgrade MSRV to v1.70
  Our MSRV follows the one of `helix`, which in turn follows Firefox.

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-6c2fa025522e008f88b0eed46613665e478bc141/> windows test seems to require links to be made by script.
   Otherwise, they are not links anymore when extracted from archive,
   unfortunately.

## 0.4.0 (2023-09-08)

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-96a07e08e6090222cf398b46aa8d46b56f81f14d/> Use `Vec::resize()` instead of set_len()
   Otherwise it's possible for uninitialized memory to be used as if it was initialized,
   which can lead to strange behaviour.
   
   As the buffer is re-used, it's not actually zeroing that much memory either.

### Bug Fixes (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-072ee32f693a31161cd6a843da6582d13efbb20b/> use `dyn` trait where possible.
   This reduces compile time due to avoiding duplication.
