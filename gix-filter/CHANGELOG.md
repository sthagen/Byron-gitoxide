## 0.18.0 (2025-04-04)

### Changed (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-5095f44db58014f4a35ea8996a90d56d2ac19d45/> adjust error return types to handle collision detection
   This does mean a lot of churn across the tree, but the change is
   usually just an adjustment to variants of an existing error type,
   so I expect that most downstream users will require little to no
   adaption for this change.
 - <csr-id-6d5c89693faf8971bc13e022c57a396d0db0ce03/> use separate error types for the `eol` and `ident` filters
   Prepare for hashing becoming fallible.

## 0.17.0 (2025-01-18)

<csr-id-17835bccb066bbc47cc137e8ec5d9fe7d5665af0/>

### Chore

 - <csr-id-17835bccb066bbc47cc137e8ec5d9fe7d5665af0/> bump `rust-version` to 1.70
   That way clippy will allow to use the fantastic `Option::is_some_and()`
   and friends.

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-304eb741fc87d1d73e564d5959a5c389dac0df51/> make sure that `rela_path` always contains `/` when used internally.
   Previously it would be possible for attribute lookups to fail on Windows
   as `\` would have snuck into paths used for lookup.

## 0.14.0 (2024-10-22)

<csr-id-64ff0a77062d35add1a2dd422bb61075647d1a36/>

### Other

 - <csr-id-64ff0a77062d35add1a2dd422bb61075647d1a36/> Update gitoxide repository URLs
   This updates `Byron/gitoxide` URLs to `GitoxideLabs/gitoxide` in:
   
   - Markdown documentation, except changelogs and other such files
     where such changes should not be made.
   
   - Documentation comments (in .rs files).
   
   - Manifest (.toml) files, for the value of the `repository` key.
   
   - The comments appearing at the top of a sample hook that contains
     a repository URL as an example.
   
   When making these changes, I also allowed my editor to remove
   trailing whitespace in any lines in files already being edited
   (since, in this case, there was no disadvantage to allowing this).
   
   The gitoxide repository URL changed when the repository was moved
   into the recently created GitHub organization `GitoxideLabs`, as
   detailed in #1406. Please note that, although I believe updating
   the URLs to their new canonical values is useful, this is not
   needed to fix any broken links, since `Byron/gitoxide` URLs
   redirect (and hopefully will always redirect) to the coresponding
   `GitoxideLabs/gitoxide` URLs.
   
   While this change should not break any URLs, some affected URLs
   were already broken. This updates them, but they are still broken.
   They will be fixed in a subsequent commit.
   
   This also does not update `Byron/gitoxide` URLs in test fixtures
   or test cases, nor in the `Makefile`. (It may make sense to change
   some of those too, but it is not really a documentation change.)

## 0.8.1 (2023-12-30)

<csr-id-3bd09ef120945a9669321ea856db4079a5dab930/>

### Chore

- <csr-id-3bd09ef120945a9669321ea856db4079a5dab930/> change `rust-version` manifest field back to 1.65.
  They didn't actually need to be higher to work, and changing them
  unecessarily can break downstream CI.

  Let's keep this value as low as possible, and only increase it when
  more recent features are actually used.

## 0.7.0 (2023-12-06)

### New Features

 - <csr-id-0f03a08e9e07979c476a7def0c045fcdfddcbb7c/> Allow obtaining mutable pipeline buffers.

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-c752f67090265dac78e43c132de1d6cced61be9c/> Use `gix-objet::Find` error type.
 - <csr-id-42d45906d67c6930cb0abb567e59834ac9ae1478/> cleanup trailing newlines when handling delayed files.
   Otherwise we would have seen newlines in filepaths, which then would
   not match any file in the list of expected paths.

### New Features (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-c74c7feea9b4404c3e0f403e22cf64561c8d12ee/> simplify `Pipeline::new()` by reomving the metadata collection.
   It's required, but in practice has no effect as it's initialized at
   just the right time anyway, which is when it does matter.
   
   Also, re-export `gix_attributes as attributes` to allow using the types
   it mentions in the public API.
 - <csr-id-c3edef1c0c49accbb037bdf086dade3ed0e5e507/> make it possible to trace incoming and outgoing packetlines.
   Due to the way this is (and has to be) setup, unfortunately one
   has to integrate that with two crates, instead of just one.
   
   This changes touches multiple crates, most of which receive a single
   boolean as last argument to indicate whether the tracing should
   happen in the first place.

### Bug Fixes (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-969ff0f6091196134307554a54e5cf82734d9252/> pass crucial context to help spawning filter processes by adding `context` to `Pipeline::new()`.
   Otherwise, they might now know which repository to apply to,
   leading to errors.

## 0.6.0 (2023-10-12)

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-b5b50f8fdb781b7c9a2ff5c8b462940e5098a94d/> hanging `Read` implementation of `pipeline::convert::ToGitOutcome`.
   This codepath was never tested and its function more subtle than one could have known.
   Also fix incorrect configuration handling which could lead to binary files with `text=auto`
   to be identified as text, which would then require conversion.

### Bug Fixes (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-260c78191e88d2e2c744d85e6f75e7941c24ef43/> don't provide path to object-retrieval callback of `Pipeline::convert::to_git::IndexObjectFn()`.
   It implies that one has to be ready to fetch any kind of path from the index, even though it's always the path to
   the file that is currently converted.
   
   Also fix a bug that could cause it to return input as unchanged even though it was read into a buffer already.

## 0.4.0 (2023-09-08)

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-96a07e08e6090222cf398b46aa8d46b56f81f14d/> Use `Vec::resize()` instead of set_len()
   Otherwise it's possible for uninitialized memory to be used as if it was initialized,
   which can lead to strange behaviour.
   
   As the buffer is re-used, it's not actually zeroing that much memory either.

### Bug Fixes (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-072ee32f693a31161cd6a843da6582d13efbb20b/> use `dyn` trait where possible.
   This reduces compile time due to avoiding duplication.

## 0.1.0 (2023-07-19)

### New Features (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-29a64c289946301d5e502ee956f3606280409faf/> make it possible to use filter pipeline with streaming for checkouts.
   This is done by providing a `gix_filter::Pipeline` to `checkout::Options` to control
   how filters are applied.
 - <csr-id-94df6e0e56c0c94e15da89dd9716bcdea5cd4380/> a complete, streaming compatible, `git` filter pipeline.
   It's configuring itself based on each input path and supports streaming.
   
   Some name changes where also performed while at it.

### Bug Fixes (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-35415db5d82b82d3908709b6db177bb8d7c3542c/> improve conversion API of `Pipeline::convert_to_git(index_object)` to be more consistent and practical.
   `index_object` now receives the path to the entry as first argument, notably in a data-type that is fitting for
   the purpose.
   Additionally, implement `Clone` for `Pipeline`.
   We also make sure that the input stream is turned into a buffer in case there is no driver, previously filtering
   had nothing to work with if there was no driver.

## 0.0.0 (2023-07-01)

<csr-id-f7f136dbe4f86e7dee1d54835c420ec07c96cd78/>
<csr-id-533e887e80c5f7ede8392884562e1c5ba56fb9a8/>

An empty crate without any content to reserve the name for the gitoxide project.

### New Features (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-3d8fa8fef9800b1576beab8a5bc39b821157a5ed/> upgrade edition to 2021 in most crates.
   MSRV for this is 1.56, and we are now at 1.60 so should be compatible.
   This isn't more than a patch release as it should break nobody
   who is adhering to the MSRV, but let's be careful and mark it
   breaking.
   
   Note that `git-features` and `git-pack` are still on edition 2018
   as they make use of a workaround to support (safe) mutable access
   to non-overlapping entries in a slice which doesn't work anymore
   in edition 2021.

### New Features

 - <csr-id-198ce27e05fd07d4e511dff1ac50c3f4ed163cdf/> API support for receiving delayed entries
 - <csr-id-5670bbba73c7d48ba6220c2e3773633c234fb21c/> Ability to steer long running filter processes.
 - <csr-id-c538c6eba466f22a3000a76a0d37902ac5256e7a/> ability to run define and run simple filters.
   Simple filters run in real-time and are piped their content to stdin
   while we read it from stdout.
 - <csr-id-d1fed3e9907d0a9e3fe45dbfe2ff27bd10b3e1f4/> `worktree::encode_to_worktree()` to turn UTf-8 into the worktree encoding.
 - <csr-id-1b8f2b7f51e7d17b9b0839f42b75781ae6f940ec/> `worktree::encode_to_git()` to turn worktree encoding to UTF-8.
 - <csr-id-1517cbc42c43b253046b7359c79731771fd7b941/> add `eol::convert_to_worktree()`.
   It's the inverse of `eol::convert_to_git()` to re-add CRLF where there were LF only.
 - <csr-id-e45fec9663f87b7ba4162a9517677f6278c20a98/> Add `eol::convert_to_git()`.
   This function supports all the logic that git executes to determine
   if a converion should actually be done.
 - <csr-id-b79ffeb9ed584c47f2609eea261e1ada557a744c/> `eol::Stats::from_bytes()` to obtain stats about a buffer.
   It can help to determine if it is binary and if line conversions should be performed at all.
 - <csr-id-306c8eabcffe80da1d627283c4b188a1b979f692/> add `ident::apply()` to substitute `$Id$` with `$Id: <hex>$`
 - <csr-id-496445ca97687a38ecb80e871a1cbdc7ecd6b313/> `ident::undo()` to replace `$Id: XXX$` with `$Id$`

### Chore

- <csr-id-f7f136dbe4f86e7dee1d54835c420ec07c96cd78/> uniformize deny attributes
- <csr-id-533e887e80c5f7ede8392884562e1c5ba56fb9a8/> remove default link to cargo doc everywhere
