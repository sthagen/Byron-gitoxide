/// A type to represent one or more line ranges to blame in a file.
///
/// It handles the conversion between git's 1-based inclusive ranges and the internal
/// 0-based exclusive ranges used by the blame algorithm.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```rust
/// use gix_blame::BlameRanges;
///
/// // Blame lines 20 through 40 (inclusive)
/// let range = BlameRanges::from_range(20..=40);
///
/// // Blame multiple ranges
/// let mut ranges = BlameRanges::new();
/// ranges.add_range(1..=4);   // Lines 1-4
/// ranges.add_range(10..=14); // Lines 10-14
/// ```
///
/// # Line Number Representation
///
/// This type uses 1-based inclusive ranges to mirror `git`'s behaviour:
/// - A range of `20..=40` represents 21 lines, spanning from line 20 up to and including line 40
/// - This will be converted to `19..40` internally as the algorithm uses 0-based ranges that are exclusive at the end
///

///

/// to blame the entire file, similar to running `git blame` without line number arguments.
