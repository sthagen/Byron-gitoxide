## 0.1.0 (2024-12-22)

### New Features (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-6367c7d0a796aff8ee8778916c1a1ddae68b654d/> Add `gix-shallow` crate and use it from `gix` and `gix-protocol`
   That way it's easier to reuse shallow-handling code from plumbing crates.
   
   Note that this is a breaking change as `gix-protocol` now uses the `gix-shallow::Update`
   type, which doesn't implement a formerly public `from_line()` method anymore.
   Now it is available as `fetch::response::shallow_update_from_line()`.
