## 0.1.6 (2023-12-30)

<csr-id-3bd09ef120945a9669321ea856db4079a5dab930/>

### Chore

- <csr-id-3bd09ef120945a9669321ea856db4079a5dab930/> change `rust-version` manifest field back to 1.65.
  They didn't actually need to be higher to work, and changing them
  unecessarily can break downstream CI.

  Let's keep this value as low as possible, and only increase it when
  more recent features are actually used.

## 0.1.2 (2023-06-29)

### New Features

 - <csr-id-d5eba46afeaadb9ff113421bdb43466d67cfeac6/> Support for events (e.g. warn!()) via macro.
   Thanks to these, one can now emit warnings which could be visible
   if the application compiled in support for it.
   
   This is a nice alternative compared to having to have a `progress` around.
 - <csr-id-ba777f3978e5c7f0275ad48a54d85ec63609aead/> panic on `record()` if field wasn't found.
   Even though this is a breaking change, it happens at runtime and should be helpful.

## v0.1.0 (2023-06-16)

### New Features

 - <csr-id-093efafa7c39aa03bfef4894779cca6e3716f471/> add `tracing` feature toggle to provide minimal tracing API
   This API is based on `tracing-core`, not on tracing, and provides a limited
   API that is always available, while being a no-op if `tracing` isn't enabled.
   
   That way, plumbing crates can add instrumentation at will.
