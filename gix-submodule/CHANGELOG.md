## 0.7.1 (2023-12-30)

<csr-id-3bd09ef120945a9669321ea856db4079a5dab930/>

### Chore

- <csr-id-3bd09ef120945a9669321ea856db4079a5dab930/> change `rust-version` manifest field back to 1.65.
  They didn't actually need to be higher to work, and changing them
  unecessarily can break downstream CI.

  Let's keep this value as low as possible, and only increase it when
  more recent features are actually used.

## 0.3.0 (2023-09-08)

### Bug Fixes (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-072ee32f693a31161cd6a843da6582d13efbb20b/> use `dyn` trait where possible.
   This reduces compile time due to avoiding duplication.
 - <csr-id-25c5bcebd4dbc4ac189d8af044ed0352c6188ce8/> `IsActivePlatform::is_active()` now only considers the URL in passed configuration
   Previously, it would consider the presence of `url` in the `.gitmodules` file as well, which is
   not the way git does it.

## 0.2.0 (2023-08-22)

<csr-id-229bd4899213f749a7cc124aa2b82a1368fba40f/>

### Chore

- <csr-id-229bd4899213f749a7cc124aa2b82a1368fba40f/> don't call crate 'WIP' in manifest anymore.

### New Features

 - <csr-id-af1cab31fd5ead445c988cce058c136c81229ad1/> TBD a way to learn if submodules are active efficiently

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-e0d9b09d02f88536b93ab6a31fddf9483881c5c1/> `Modules::is_active()` now counts everything that doesn't match `submodule.active` (if present) as inactive.
 - <csr-id-8172f0e0f19e84fdaedceb87399f3fab4a1eb563/> Assure `gix-submodule` works with Rust 1.65.
   The previous version of this loop, possibly preferable, ran into
   a borrow-check issue that was no more from Rust 1.70 onwards.

### New Features (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-3503f4948b42854256c9e8d8336ebe222fee980b/> remove `File::names_and_active_state()` in favor of `File::is_active_platform()`.
   With this platform it's possible to make repeated checks to see if a named submodule is active.
 - <csr-id-4a443e453285095daccdca0fed9e8486ce7892ab/> make API less error prone by enforcing overrides at instantiation time.
   It's made so that overrides can still be applied at a later point.
