/// An iterator for changes between the index and the worktree and the head-tree and the index.
///
/// Note that depending on the underlying configuration, there might be a significant delay until the first
/// item is received due to the buffering necessary to perform rename tracking and/or sorting.
///
/// ### Submodules
///
/// Note that submodules can be set to 'inactive', which will not exclude them from the status operation, similar to
/// how `git status` includes them.
///
/// ### Index Changes
///
/// Changes to the index are collected, and it's possible to write the index back using [Outcome::write_changes()].
/// Note that these changes are not observable, they will always be kept.
///
/// ### Parallel Operation
///
/// Note that without the `parallel` feature, the iterator becomes 'serial', which means all status will be computed in advance,
/// and it's non-interruptible, yielding worse performance for is-dirty checks for instance as interruptions won't happen.
/// It's a crutch that is just there to make single-threaded applications possible at all, as it's not really an iterator
/// anymore. If this matters, better run [Repository::index_worktree_status()](crate::Repository::index_worktree_status) by hand
/// as it provides all control one would need, just not as an iterator.
///
/// Also, even with `parallel` set, the first call to `next()` will block until there is an item available, without a chance
/// to interrupt unless [`status::Platform::should_interrupt_*()`](crate::status::Platform::should_interrupt_shared()) was
/// configured.
