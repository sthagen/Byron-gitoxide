## 0.15.0 (2022-07-22)

### Changed (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-89a41bf2b37db29b9983b4e5492cfd67ed490b23/> remove local-time-support feature toggle.
   We treat local time as default feature without a lot of fuzz, and
   will eventually document that definitive support needs a compile
   time switch in the compiler (`--cfg unsound_local_offset` or something).
   
   One day it will perish. Failure is possible anyway and we will write
   code to deal with it while minimizing the amount of system time
   fetches when asking for the current local time.
 - <csr-id-6f4eea936d64fb9827277c160f989168e7b1dba2/> Associate `file::Metadata` with each `File`.
   This is the first step towards knowing more about the source of each
   value to filter them based on some properties.
   
   This breaks various methods handling the instantiation of configuration
   files as `file::Metadata` typically has to be provided by the caller
   now or be associated with each path to read configuration from.

### New Features

 - <csr-id-eda39ec7d736d49af1ad9e2ad775e4aa12b264b7/> `gix config` with section and sub-section filtering.
 - <csr-id-d99453ebeb970ed493be236def299d1e82b01f83/> `gix config` lists all entries of all configuration files git considers.
   Filters allow to narrow down the output.
 - <csr-id-7f67b23b9462b805591b1fe5a8406f8d7404f372/> Use `git-config` to write config file on initialization, including `logallrefupdates` and `precomposeunicode`.

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-5667a7c1bafcfdff1a278b3ad0e1198cd0cc4653/> `ein tool organize` now ignores worktrees.
   Previously it would report an error due to invalid assumptions.
   The new behaviour acknowledges that worktrees are placed by hand
   and moving them is almost always not what the user would want,
   even ignoring the added complexity in doing so correctly.

## 0.14.0 (2022-04-05)

### New Features

 - <csr-id-7e99e6aeee9bf200a561d215c586301f5e4a8cbc/> Add `gix repo commit describe`
   It supports typical but basic flags mostly similar to the ones in git.
 - <csr-id-654f4afb794a370b7cd9d9502ff6d0c3378ec417/> `Commit::describe()`
   A way to fluidly configure a `git describe` operation and run it.
   
   Along that, a new `Tag` top-level object was added as well to provide
   convenient access to otherwise lower-level objects. It's not strictly
   required for our implementation here but it's needed for a symmetric
   API.

<csr-id-424c9b3a2b467f5a1e339700257cd4ab72e2e692/>

### Refactor (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-bbc6efeceb26050973e1425e68a52e51b9df4572/> clarify different repository types much better
 - <csr-id-4d2d433e7e98ac42db858688edac06e68ee4d10d/> Remove light* features, add 'lean-async' in its place; remove termion support
 - <csr-id-ebc7f47708a63c3df4415ba0e702660d976dfb3e/> remove pack-cache from `Find::try_find(…)`
   With the new architecture this can be an implementation detail without
   forcing it to be Sync.
 - <csr-id-2290d006705ff47ad780b009fe58ee422b3285af/> move git_pack::data::Object to git_object::Data, massively alter git_odb::Find trait
   This will break a lot, but has to happen to prepare these traits for the
   next generation of object databases.

### Other

 - <csr-id-424c9b3a2b467f5a1e339700257cd4ab72e2e692/> Try to make Handle usable for pack creation
   It's nearly there, but for some reason the boxed dyn traits don't get to
   be Send even though it's specified.

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-84ade1d23060f10bf6c8529f8f693d06660b4f4e/> Allow resolution of in-pack ref-deltas
   This finally allows delta tree caches to be used on typical small packs
   returned by GitHub.
 - <csr-id-d33795f9e99d5ad7191c807e42a6fce368932f6b/> keep non "git" repository name extensions
   When converting a remote URL to a destination directory name,
   keep extension strings if they are not equal to "git". For example,
 - <csr-id-6d3f52dc13d7243a6bce6dab89a985114a75d94b/> Avoid the dashmap being cloned for each thread
   Intead, share it by reference, it's sync after all.
   
   This issue was introduced when switching to a `Send + Clone` model,
   instead of `Send + Sync`, to allow thread-local caches in database
   handles of all kinds.

### New Features

 - <csr-id-30b22a870f22a8ad124f15a7d5395a707c1c8fa4/> ein tool estimate-hours with shallow clone support
 - <csr-id-def80df2e165b74f4b053e4030f563902b7d34a4/> `ein tool estimate-hours` now supports mailmaps
 - <csr-id-d2388d8d80f379eccc9ee84ebe07acd67d154630/> `gix repository mailmap entries`
 - <csr-id-384ed665c7423feca1b1ee1f81db10867fa813a8/> `gix mailmap verify` command
 - <csr-id-e3bc1b410409a9e27894a5cac48b06d8c3295e36/> unstable mailmap module
 - <csr-id-3f28e2037fcb07fa022220e52bcf967d6d6ef647/> `ein find` with support for worktree checkouts
 - <csr-id-70109bee679d33a5c5fb3a78a708b479684b03b1/> `ein find --debug` to learn why it is slow
 - <csr-id-00909619ff04e247aabc9ffe3c025f0064c3092d/> --counting-threads flag to configure amount of threads when counting
   The efficiency of multi-threaded counting is low per core, and despite
   some speedups might be desirable, one might not want to commit all cores
   to this amount of waste.
 - <csr-id-aa3795d69926c4506e5bc2d14f447d64bc4e6c2c/> in-manifest and in-lib documentation of feature toggles

### Changed (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-15d429bb50602363292453606902bdce5042d9a5/> file::Store::(try_)find(…, packed) was removed
   The packed buffer is now handled internally while loading it on demand.
   When compiled with `git-features/parallel` the `file::Store` remains
   send and sync.
   
   The packed refs buffer is shared across clones and it's recommended
   to clone one `file::Store` instance per thread, each of which can
   use its own namespace.
 - <csr-id-e7526b2a7b51cbac4018e1ab3b623a85987fadc2/> parallel utilities now use `Send + Clone` insted of `Send + Sync`
   This helps to assure that thread-local computations always work with the
   kind of types we provide. The ones that are carrying out actions are
   notably not `Sync` anymore.
   
   We cater to that by defining our bounds accordingly, but for those
   who want to use other utilities that need Sync, using types like
   `Repository` and `thread_local!()` is the only way to make this
   work.
 - <csr-id-e8b091943f0c9a26317da0003f7fcdf5a56ef21a/> Rename gix->ein and gixp->gix
 - <csr-id-bf04644ab75ed1969507f957dc8d4868790d462d/> remove `Option<impl Progress>` in favor of `impl Progress`
 - <csr-id-6829e5e5d6aed1e6c87647144e2dd76a1e4b9f1f/> multi-index integrity check; use `integrity::Outcome` for various integrity checks
 - <csr-id-d851bede97801096d188ff6af06c98a79fe276db/> remove unnecessary `Arc` around `should_interrupt` flag
 - <csr-id-c2679a03358b9c19d63ed1af1cd57324c6381447/> remove Sha1 mentions in `index::verify::Mode::*` variants
   The hash is repository defined and not hard-coded
 - <csr-id-80b120d3278e46429f848df7af3db13413c36649/> introduce `index::File::verify_integrity(…, pack: Option<PackContext>, …)`, replacing tuple
   This allows for more documentation on what input is required there and
   generally makes for an easier to use API.
 - <csr-id-de4fa64843e2c26b86eaaeadd9d6514c96029a9f/> consistently use `object_hash` instead of `hash_kind`
