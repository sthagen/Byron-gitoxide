## 0.1.0 (2026-08-22)

### Chore

 - <csr-id-3e05ca352597ef5966fa4dc4f52456c2424cddad/> add package.include directives to control which files are packaged.
 - <csr-id-17835bccb066bbc47cc137e8ec5d9fe7d5665af0/> bump `rust-version` to 1.70
   That way clippy will allow to use the fantastic `Option::is_some_and()`
   and friends.
 - <csr-id-3bd09ef120945a9669321ea856db4079a5dab930/> change `rust-version` manifest field back to 1.65.
   They didn't actually need to be higher to work, and changing them
   unecessarily can break downstream CI.
   
   Let's keep this value as low as possible, and only increase it when
   more recent features are actually used.
 - <csr-id-aea89c3ad52f1a800abb620e9a4701bdf904ff7d/> upgrade MSRV to v1.70
   Our MSRV follows the one of `helix`, which in turn follows Firefox.

### Documentation

 - <csr-id-64ff0a77062d35add1a2dd422bb61075647d1a36/> Update gitoxide repository URLs
   This updates `Byron/gitoxide` URLs to `GitoxideLabs/gitoxide` in:
   
   - Markdown documentation, except changelogs and other such files
     where such changes should not be made.
   
   - Documentation comments (in .rs files).
   
   - Manifest (.toml) files, for the value of the `repository` key.
   
   - The comments appearing at the top of a sample hook that contains
     a repository URL as an example.
   
   When making these changes, I also allowed my editor to remove
   trailing whitespace in any lines in files already being edited
   (since, in this case, there was no disadvantage to allowing this).
   
   The gitoxide repository URL changed when the repository was moved
   into the recently created GitHub organization `GitoxideLabs`, as
   detailed in #1406. Please note that, although I believe updating
   the URLs to their new canonical values is useful, this is not
   needed to fix any broken links, since `Byron/gitoxide` URLs
   redirect (and hopefully will always redirect) to the coresponding
   `GitoxideLabs/gitoxide` URLs.
   
   While this change should not break any URLs, some affected URLs
   were already broken. This updates them, but they are still broken.
   They will be fixed in a subsequent commit.
   
   This also does not update `Byron/gitoxide` URLs in test fixtures
   or test cases, nor in the `Makefile`. (It may make sense to change
   some of those too, but it is not really a documentation change.)

### New Features

 - <csr-id-d21b52afaaae0cb5312aa3d474f476166546b760/> support note mutation in gix-note
   <!-- agent -->
   Add plumbing operations to insert, replace, and remove note mappings while
   returning the rewritten root tree and the previous note id.
   
   Rebuild notes using the same dynamic fanout rule as Git so growing and shrinking
   collections remain compatible with existing notes trees. Preserve unrelated
   entries during rewriting, reject mixed object-hash kinds, report duplicate
   mappings, and leave the tree unchanged when removing a missing note.
   
   Keep object persistence delegated through Find and Write traits, allowing
   callers to decide how commits and refs are updated.
 - <csr-id-048bfd3058cb122c5155f59136b24d522681d62b/> support lazy note lookup in gix-note
   <!-- agent -->
   Establish the minimal plumbing API needed to query notes efficiently for many
   objects, such as every commit visible in a history view.
   
   Resolve note blobs through Git notes progressive two-hex-digit fanout trees
   and use Git tree ordering for direct entry lookup. Load only trees along the
   requested object path and retain decoded trees in a caller-owned cache that can
   be reused across lookups and notes roots.
   
   Ignore entries that do not form valid notes instead of mistaking arbitrary tree
   contents for mappings. Use gix-error for contextual failures.

## 0.0.0 (2023-08-17)

An empty crate without any content to reserve the name for the gitoxide project.

### New Features (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-3d8fa8fef9800b1576beab8a5bc39b821157a5ed/> upgrade edition to 2021 in most crates.
   MSRV for this is 1.56, and we are now at 1.60 so should be compatible.
   This isn't more than a patch release as it should break nobody
   who is adhering to the MSRV, but let's be careful and mark it
   breaking.
   
   Note that `git-features` and `git-pack` are still on edition 2018
   as they make use of a workaround to support (safe) mutable access
   to non-overlapping entries in a slice which doesn't work anymore
   in edition 2021.

### Chore

 - <csr-id-229bd4899213f749a7cc124aa2b82a1368fba40f/> don't call crate 'WIP' in manifest anymore.
 - <csr-id-f7f136dbe4f86e7dee1d54835c420ec07c96cd78/> uniformize deny attributes
 - <csr-id-533e887e80c5f7ede8392884562e1c5ba56fb9a8/> remove default link to cargo doc everywhere
