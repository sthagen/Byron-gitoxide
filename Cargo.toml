#! ### Build Configuration
#! These combine common choices of building blocks to represent typical builds.

## Everything, all at once.
##
## As fast as possible, tracing, with TUI progress, progress line rendering with autoconfiguration, all transports based on their most mature implementation (HTTP), all `ein` tools, CLI colors and local-time support, JSON output, regex support for rev-specs.
## Can be amended with the `http-client-curl-rustls` feature to avoid `openssl` as backend.
max = ["max-control", "fast", "gitoxide-core-tools-query", "gitoxide-core-tools-corpus", "gitoxide-core-blocking-client", "http-client-curl"]

## Like `max`, but only Rust is allowed.
##
## This is the most compatible build as it won't need a C compiler or C toolchains to build. It's also not the fastest as or the most feature-rich in terms of available
## transports as it uses Rust's HTTP implementation.
##
## As fast as possible, with TUI progress, progress line rendering with auto-configuration, all transports available but less mature pure Rust HTTP implementation, all `ein` tools, CLI colors and local-time support, JSON output, regex support for rev-specs.
max-pure = ["max-control", "gix-features/rustsha1", "gix-features/zlib-rust-backend", "http-client-reqwest", "gitoxide-core-blocking-client"]

## Like `max`, but with more control for configuration. See the *Package Maintainers* headline for more information.
max-control = ["tracing", "fast-safe", "pretty-cli", "gitoxide-core-tools", "prodash-render-line", "prodash-render-tui", "prodash/render-line-autoconfigure", "gix/revparse-regex"]

## All the good stuff, with less fanciness for smaller binaries.
##
## As fast as possible, progress line rendering, all transports based on their most mature implementation (HTTP), all `ein` tools, CLI colors and local-time support, JSON output.
lean = ["fast", "tracing", "pretty-cli", "http-client-curl", "gitoxide-core-tools-query", "gitoxide-core-tools-corpus", "gitoxide-core-tools", "gitoxide-core-blocking-client", "prodash-render-line"]

## The smallest possible build, best suitable for small single-core machines.
##
## This build is essentially limited to local operations without any fanciness.
##
## Optimized for size, no parallelism thus much slower, progress line rendering.
small = ["pretty-cli", "gix-features/rustsha1", "gix-features/zlib-rust-backend", "prodash-render-line", "is-terminal"]

## Like lean, but uses Rusts async implementations for networking.
##
## This build is more of a demonstration showing how async can work with `gitoxide`, which generally is blocking. This also means that the selection of async transports
## is very limited to only HTTP (without typical `git` configuration) and git over TCP like provided by the `git daemon`.
##
## As fast as possible, progress line rendering, less featureful HTTP (pure Rust) and only `git-daemon` support, all `ein` tools, CLI colors and local-time support, JSON output.
##
## Due to async client-networking not being implemented for most transports, this one supports only the 'git+tcp' and HTTP transport.
## It uses, however, a fully asynchronous networking implementation which can serve a real-world example on how to implement custom async transports.

#! ### Package Maintainers
#! `*-control` features leave it to you to configure C libraries, involving choices for `zlib`, ! hashing and transport implementation.
#!
#! Additional features *can* be provided with `--features` and are handled by the [`gix-features` crate](https://docs.rs/gix-features/latest).
#! If nothing else is specified, the Rust implementation is used. ! Note that only one feature of each section can be enabled at a time.
#!
#! * **zlib**
#!     - `gix-features/zlib-ng`
#!     - `gix-features/zlib-ng-compat`
#!     - `gix-features/zlib-stock`
#!     - `gix-features/zlib-rust-backend` (*default if no choice is made*)
#! * **sha1**
#!     - `gix-features/fast-sha1`
#!     - `gix-features/rustsha1` (*default if no choice is made*)
#! * **HTTP** - see the *Building Blocks for mutually exclusive networking* headline
#!
#! #### Examples
#!
#! * `cargo build --release --no-default-features --features max-control,gix-features/zlib-stock,gitoxide-core-blocking-client,http-client-curl`
#!     - Create a build just like `max`, but using the stock `zlib` library instead of `zlib-ng`
#! * `cargo build --release --no-default-features --features max-control,http-client-reqwest,gitoxide-core-blocking-client,gix-features/fast-sha1`
#!     - Create a build just like `max-pure`, but with faster hashing due to `fast-sha1`.

#! ### Building Blocks
#! Typical combinations of features of our dependencies, some of which are referred to in the `gitoxide` crate's code for conditional compilation.

## Makes the crate execute as fast as possible by supporting parallel computation of otherwise long-running functions
## as well as fast, hardware accelerated hashing, along with a faster zlib backend.
## If disabled, the binary will be visibly smaller.
fast = ["gix/max-performance", "gix/comfort"]

## Makes the crate execute as fast as possible by supporting parallel computation of otherwise long-running functions
## as well as fast, hardware accelerated hashing, along with a faster zlib backend.
## If disabled, the binary will be visibly smaller.
fast-safe = ["gix/max-performance-safe", "gix/comfort"]

## Enable tracing in `gitoxide-core`.
tracing = ["dep:tracing-forest", "dep:tracing-subscriber", "dep:tracing", "gix-features/tracing", "gix-features/tracing-detail"]

## Use `clap` 3.0 to build the prettiest, best documented and most user-friendly CLI at the expense of binary size.
## Provides a terminal user interface for detailed and exhaustive progress.
## Provides a line renderer for leaner progress display, without the need for a full-blown TUI.
pretty-cli = ["gitoxide-core/serde", "prodash/progress-tree", "prodash/progress-tree-log", "prodash/local-time", "env_logger/humantime", "env_logger/color", "env_logger/auto-color"]

## The `--verbose` flag will be powered by an interactive progress mechanism that doubles as log as well as interactive progress
## that appears after a short duration.
prodash-render-line-crossterm = ["prodash-render-line", "prodash/render-line-crossterm", "prodash/signal-hook", "is-terminal", "crosstermion"]

## Progress reporting with a TUI, can then be enabled with the `--progress` flag.
prodash-render-tui = ["prodash/render-tui", "prodash/render-tui-crossterm", "gix/progress-tree", "futures-lite"]

## Progress reporting by visually drawing lines into the terminal without switching to an alternate window.
prodash-render-line = ["prodash/render-line", "prodash-render-line-crossterm", "gix/progress-tree"]

## Prints statistical information to inform about cache efficiency when those are dropped.
## Use this as a way to understand if bigger caches actually produce greater yiedls.
cache-efficiency-debug = ["gix-features/cache-efficiency-debug"]

##  A way to enable most `gitoxide-core` tools found in `ein tools`, namely `organize` and `estimate hours`.
gitoxide-core-tools = ["gitoxide-core/organize", "gitoxide-core/estimate-hours", "gitoxide-core-tools-archive", "gitoxide-core-tools-clean"]

## A program to perform analytics on a `git` repository, using an auto-maintained sqlite database
gitoxide-core-tools-query = ["gitoxide-core/query"]

## A program to run algorithms on a corpus of repositories, recording each run for later comparison.
gitoxide-core-tools-corpus = ["gitoxide-core/corpus"]

## A sub-command to generate archive from virtual worktree checkouts.
gitoxide-core-tools-archive = ["gitoxide-core/archive"]

## A sub-command to clean the worktree from untracked and ignored files.
gitoxide-core-tools-clean = ["gitoxide-core/clean"]

#! ### Building Blocks for mutually exclusive networking
#! Blocking and async features are mutually exclusive and cause a compile-time error. This also means that `cargo â€¦ --all-features` will fail.
#! Within each section, features can be combined.
#!
#! #### Blocking
#! The backends are mutually exclusive, e.g. choose either `curl` or `request`.
#!
## Use blocking client networking.
gitoxide-core-blocking-client = ["gitoxide-core/blocking-client"]
## Support synchronous 'http' and 'https' transports (e.g. for clone, fetch and push) using **curl**.
http-client-curl = ["gix/blocking-http-transport-curl"]
## Implies `http-client-curl` and configures `curl` to use the `rust-tls` backend.
http-client-curl-rustls = ["gix/blocking-http-transport-curl-rustls"]
## Support synchronous 'http' and 'https' transports (e.g. for clone, fetch and push) using **reqwest**.
http-client-reqwest = ["gix/blocking-http-transport-reqwest-rust-tls"]

#! #### Async
#!
## Use async client networking.
gitoxide-core-async-client = ["gitoxide-core/async-client", "futures-lite"]
