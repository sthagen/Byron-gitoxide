## Cargo features guide

Cargo uses feature toggles to control which dependencies are pulled in, allowing users to specialize crates to fit their usage.
Ideally, these should be additive.
This guide documents which features are available for each of the crates provided here and how they function.

### gitoxide

The top-level command-line interface.

* **fast**
    * Makes the crate execute as fast as possible by supporting parallel computation of otherwise long-running functions
      as well as fast, hardware accelerated hashing, along with a faster zlib backend.
    * If disabled, the binary will be visibly smaller.
* **http**
    * support synchronous 'http' and 'https' transports (e.g. for clone, fetch and push) at the expense of compile times and binary size
* _(mutually exclusive)_
    * **pretty-cli**
        * Use `clap` 3.0 to build the prettiest, best documented and most user-friendly CLI at the expense of binary size.
        * provides a terminal user interface for detailed and exhaustive progress.
        * provides a line renderer for leaner progress
    * **lean-cli**
        * Use `argh` to produce a usable binary with decent documentation that is smallest in size, usually 300kb less than `pretty-cli`.
        * If `pretty-cli` is enabled as well, `lean-cli` will take precedence, and you pay for building unnecessary dependencies.
        * provides a line renderer for lean but pretty progress
* **prodash-render-line-crossterm** or **prodash-render-line-termion** _(mutually exclusive)_
    * The `--verbose` flag will be powered by an interactive progress mechanism that doubles as log as well as interactive progress
      that appears after a short duration.
* **gitoxide-core-tools**
    * A way to enable all `gitoxide-core` tools found in `gix tools`
* _mutually exclusive_    
    * If both are set a compile error is triggered. This also means that `cargo â€¦ --all-features` will fail.
    * **gitoxide-core-blocking-client**
        * Use blocking client networking.
    * **gitoxide-core-async-client**
      * Use async client networking.

There are **convenience features**, which combine common choices of the above into one name

* **max** = *pretty-cli* + *fast* + *prodash-render-tui-crossterm* + *http* + *gitoxide-core-organize* + *client-networking*
    * _default_, for unix and windows
* **max-termion** = *pretty-cli* + *fast* + *prodash-render-tui-termion* + *http* + *gitoxide-core-organize* + *client-networking*
    * for unix only, faster compile times, a little smaller
* **lean** = *lean-cli* + *fast* + *prodash-render-line-crossterm* + *gitoxide-core-organize* + *client-networking*
    * for unix and windows, significantly smaller than _max_, but without `--progress` terminal user interface.
* **lean-termion** = *lean-cli* + *fast* + *prodash-render-line-termion* + *gitoxide-core-organize* + *client-networking*
    * for unix only, faster compile times, a little smaller
* **light** = *lean-cli* + *fast* + *gitoxide-core-organize* + *client-networking*
    * crossplatform by nature as this comes with simplified log based progress
* **light-async** = *lean-cli* + *fast* + *gitoxide-core-organize* + *client-async-networking*
   * Due to async client-networking not being implemented for most transports, this one supports only the 'git' transport. It uses, however, a fully asynchronous
     networking implementation which can serve a real-world example on how to implement custom async transports.
* **small** = *lean-cli*
    * As small as it can possibly be, no threading, no fast sha1, log based progress only, no cleanup of temporary files on interrupt, rust based zlib implementation.
    * no networking, local operations only.

### gitoxide-core

The library powering the command-line interface.

* **organize**
    * **provides the 'organize' command**
        * Includes `jwalk` to find repositories quickly in order to move into a directory structure automatically.
    * **provides the 'find' command**
        * discover all git repositories within a directory. Particularly useful with [skim][skim].
* **estimate-hours**
    * Derive the amount of time invested akin to [git-hours].
* _mutually exclusive_    
  - if both are set, _blocking-client_ will take precedence.
  - **blocking-client**
    - If set, the client used to connect to git servers will use a blocking API. It supports more transports and is what most would want.
  - **async-client**
    - The client to connect to git servers will be async, while supporting only the 'git' transport itself. It's the most limited and can be seen as example
      on how to use custom transports for custom servers.
* **local-time-support**
    - Functions dealing with time may include the local timezone offset, not just UTC with the offset being zero.

### git-pack

* **pack-cache-lru-static**
    * Provide a fixed-size allocation-free LRU cache for packs. It's useful if caching is desired while keeping the memory footprint
      for the LRU-cache itself low.
* **pack-cache-lru-dynamic**
    * Provide a hash-map based LRU cache whose eviction is based a memory cap calculated from object data.
* **object-cache-dynamic**
    * If set, select algorithms may additionally use a full-object cache which is queried before the pack itself.
   
### git-actor

* **local-time-support**
   - Make `Signature` initializers using the local time (with UTC offset) available.

### git-features

A crate to help controlling which capabilities are available from the top-level crate that uses `gitoxide-core` or any other
`gitoxide` crate that uses `git-features`.
All feature toggles are additive.

* **progress**
    * Provide traits and utilities for providing progress information. These can then be rendered using facilities provided by
      the `prodash` crate.
* **parallel**
    * Use scoped threads and channels to parallelize common workloads on multiple objects. If enabled, it is used everywhere
      where it makes sense.
    * As caches are likely to be used and instantiated per thread, more memory will be used on top of the costs for threads.
* **crc32**
    * provide a proven and fast `crc32` implementation.
* **io-pipe**
    * an in-memory unidirectional pipe using `bytes` as efficient transfer mechanism
* **zlib**
    * Enable the usage of zlib related utilities to compress or decompress data.
    * By default it uses a pure rust implementation which is slower than the **zlib-ng-compat** version, but might be relevant if you prefer a pure-rust build
      and reduced performance is acceptable. Note that a competitive Zlib implementation is critical to `gitoxide's` performance.
    * Additional backends are supported, each of which overriding the default Rust backend.
      * _mutually-exclusive_
       * **zlib-ng-compat**
         * Use a C-based backend which can compress and decompress significantly faster.
      * **cloudflare-zlib**
         * Another incarnation of a faster-than-normal zlib backend.
      * **_zlib-rust-backend_**
         * available for completeness even though it's the default - it may be chosen for more maintainable feature flags.
    
* **walkdir**
    * Makes facilities of the `walkdir` crate partially available.
    * In conjunction with the **parallel** feature, directory walking will be parallel instead behind a compatible interface.
* _mutually-exclusive_
    * **fast-sha1**
        * a multi-crate implementation that can use hardware acceleration, thus bearing the potential for up to 2Gb/s throughput on
          CPUs that support it, like AMD Ryzen or Intel Core i3, as well as Apple Silicon like M1.
        * Takes precedence over `rustsha1` if both are specified.
        * A fast SHA1 implementation is critical to `gitoxide's` performance
    * **rustsha1**
        * A standard and well performing pure Rust implementation of Sha1. Will significantly slow down various git operations.

* **cache-efficiency-debug**
    * Caches implement this by default, which costs nothing unless this feature is enabled
    * Count cache hits and misses and print that debug information on drop
* **time**
    * Make the `time` module available with access to the local time as configured by the system.
     
### git-packetline

By default, all IO related capabilities will be missing unless one of the following is chosen.

* _mutually exclusive_
    - Specifying both causes a compile error, preventing the use of `--all-features`.
  * **blocking-io**
    * If set, all IO will become blocking. The same types will be used preventing side-by-side usage of blocking and non-blocking IO
  * **async-io**
    * Implement IO traits from `futures-io` 
    

### git-transport

The _client_ portion of transport can be blocking or async. If none is selected, it will be missing entirely.

- _mutually exclusive_
    - Specifying both causes a compile error, preventing the use of `--all-features`.
    - **blocking-client**
      - If set, blocking implementations of the typical git transports become available in `crate::client`
      - **http-client-curl**
          - Adds support for the http and https transports using the Rust bindings for `libcurl`
  - **async-client**
      - If set, an async implementations of the git transports becomes available in `crate::client`.
      - Suitable for implementing your own transports while using git's way of communication, typically in conjunction with a custom server.
         - **Note** that the _blocking_ client has a wide range of available transports, with the _async_ version of it supporting only the TCP based `git` transport leaving you
            with the responsibility to providing such an implementation of `futures-io::AsyncRead/AsyncWrite` yourself.
    
### git-protocol

The _client_ portion of the protocol uses `git-transport` to communicate to a server. For it to be available, one of the following features must
be selected.

- _mutually exclusive_ 
    - Specifying both causes a compile error, preventing the use of `--all-features`.
    * **blocking-client**
      * If set, blocking command implementations are available and will use the blocking version of the `git-transport` crate.
    * **async-client**
      * As above, but provides async implementations instead.
    
### git-object

* **verbose-object-parsing-errors**
  - When parsing objects by default errors will only be available on the granularity of success or failure, and with the above flag enabled
    details information about the error location will be collected.
  - Use it in applications which expect broken or invalid objects or for debugging purposes. Incorrectly formatted objects aren't at all
    common otherwise.
  
### git-repository

* **unstable**
  - Re-export stability tier 2 crates for convenience and make `Repository` struct fields with types from these crates publicly accessible.
  - Doing so is less stable than the stability tier 1 that `git-repository` is a member of.
* **local-time-support**
  - Functions dealing with time may include the local timezone offset, not just UTC with the offset being zero.
* **async/blocking-network-client**
  - Make `git-protocol` available along with an async or blocking client.
  - **blocking-transport-http** 
     - Stacks with `protocol-blocking-client` to provide support for HTTP/S

The following toggles can be used to reduce dependencies.

* **local**
  - Provide additional non-networked functionality 
* **network**
  - Provide networked functionality
* **one-stop-shop** = _local_ + _network_

### Serialization Support

What follows is feature toggles to control serialization of all public facing simple data types.

* **serde1**
    * Data structures implement `serde::Serialize` and `serde::Deserialize`

The feature above is provided by the crates:

* **git-actor**
* **git-object**
* **git-ref**
* **git-url**
* **git-odb**
* **git-protocol**
* **git-repository**
* **gitoxide-core**
