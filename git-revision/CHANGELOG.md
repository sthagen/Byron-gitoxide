## 0.1.0 (2022-04-05)

<csr-id-0a7776b8cce4c40c391f46542f6e7ba6830d6fc0/>

### Refactor (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-0a7776b8cce4c40c391f46542f6e7ba6830d6fc0/> Make `describe::Format` more consistent with other builder APIs
   Configuration methods now take an argument which makes it more
   straightforward to use for most.
