### New Features

 - <csr-id-d0fab1e7f083088f607365ceec056e6e521cbdcc/> new `file::Index::highest_offset()` method
   With it it's simpler to figure out from where to read trailing
   checksums.

### New Features (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-9d9f2ee55202788910cd955cdcc08196d18f2cf5/> Use `[u8;4]` as chunk id
   This allows to remove the additional string to describe the ids, which
   are usually ascii anyway.
