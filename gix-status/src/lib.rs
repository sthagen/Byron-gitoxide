//! This crate includes the various diffs `git` can do between different representations
//! of the repository state, like comparisons between…
//!
//! * index and working tree
//! * *tree and index*
//!
//! …while also being able to check if the working tree is dirty, quickly, by instructing the operation to stop once the first
//! change was found.
//!
//! ### Tree-Index Status
//!
//! This status is not actually implemented here as it's not implemented directly. Instead, one creates an Index from a tree
//! and then diffs two indices with `gix_diff::index(index_from_tree, usually_dot_git_index)`. This adds about 15% to the runtime
//! and comes at the cost of another index in memory.
//! Once there are generators implementing depth-first tree iteration should become trivial, but for now it's very hard if one
//! wants to return referenced state of the iterator (which is not possible).
//!
//! ### Difference to `gix-diff`
//!
//! Technically, `status` is just another form of diff between different kind of sides, i.e. an index and a working tree.
//! This is the difference to `gix-diff`, which compares only similar items.
//!
