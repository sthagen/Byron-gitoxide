## 0.1.1 (2022-05-18)

<csr-id-e4f4c4b2c75a63a40a174e3a006ea64ef8d78809/>

### New Features

 - <csr-id-35f146a8573dcc9a1de3230373c0cf0794c6b897/> Add `absolutize_components()`
   It helps to cleanup paths a little which comes in handy when dealing
   with `commondir` appended paths.

### Other

 - <csr-id-e4f4c4b2c75a63a40a174e3a006ea64ef8d78809/> :discover()` now returns the shortest path.
   If and only if it canonicalized the source path. That way, users will
   still get a familiar path. This is due to `parent()` not operating
   in the file system, which otherwise would be equivalent to `..`,
   but that's not how we work.
   
   Maybe we should overhaul the way this works to use `../` instead
   and just 'absoluteize' the path later (std::path::absolute()) is
   on the way for that.
