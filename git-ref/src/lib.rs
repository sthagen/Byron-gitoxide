//! A crate for handling the references stored in various formats in a git repository.
//!
//! References are also called _refs_ which are used interchangeably.
//!
//! Refs are the way to keep track of objects and come in two flavors.
//!
//! * symbolic refs are pointing to another reference
//! * peeled refs point to the an object by its [ObjectId][git_hash::ObjectId]
//!
//! They can be identified by a relative path and stored in various flavors.
//!
//! * **files**
//!   * **[loose][file::Store]**
//!     * one reference maps to a file on disk
//!   * **packed**
//!     * references are stored in a single human-readable file, along with their targets if they are symbolic.
//! * **ref-table**
//!   * supersedes all of the above to allow handling hundreds of thousands of references.
