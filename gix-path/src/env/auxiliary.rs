/// These are the values of the "Prefix" column of the "Environments" and "Legacy Environments"
/// tables in the [MSYS2 Environments](https://www.msys2.org/docs/environments/) documentation,
/// with the leading `/` separator removed, except that this does not list `usr` itself.
///
/// On Windows, we prefer to use `sh` as provided by Git for Windows, when present. To find it, we
/// run `git --exec-path` to get a path that is usually `<platform>/libexec/git-core` in the Git
/// for Windows installation, where `<platform>` is something like `mingw64`. It is also acceptable
/// to find `sh` in an environment not provided by Git for Windows, such as an independent MSYS2
/// environment in which a `git` package has been installed. However, in an unusual installation,
/// or if the user has set a custom value of `GIT_EXEC_PATH`, the output of `git --exec-path` may
/// take a form other than `<platform>/libexec/git-core`, such that finding shell at a location
/// like `../../../bin/sh.exe` relative to it should not be attempted. We lower the risk by
/// checking that `<platform>` is a plausible value that is not likely to have any other meaning.
///
/// This involves two tradeoffs. First, it may be reasonable to find `sh.exe` in an environment
/// that is not MSYS2 at all, for which in principle the prefix could be different. But listing
/// more prefixes or matching a broad pattern of platform-like strings might be too broad. So only
/// prefixes that have been used in MSYS2 are considered.
///
/// Second, we don't recognize `usr` itself here, even though it is a plausible prefix. In MSYS2,
/// it is the prefix for MSYS2 non-native programs, i.e. those that use `msys-2.0.dll`. But unlike
/// the `<platform>` names we recognize, `usr` also has an effectively unbounded range of plausible
/// meanings on non-Unix systems (for example, what should we take `Z:\usr` to mean?), which might
/// occasionally relate to subdirectories with contents controlled by different *user accounts*.
///
/// If we start with a `libexec/git-core` directory that we already use and trust, and it is in a
/// directory with a name like `mingw64`, we infer that this `mingw64` directory has the expected
/// meaning and accordingly infer that its `usr` sibling, if present, is acceptable to treat as
/// though it is a first-level directory inside an MSYS2-like tree. So we are willing to traverse
/// down to `usr/sh.exe` and try to use it. But if the `libexec/git-core` we use and trust is in a
/// directory named `usr`, that `usr` directory may still not have the meaning we expect of `usr`.
///
/// Conditions for a privilege escalation attack or other serious malfunction seem far-fetched. If
/// further research finds the risk is low enough, `usr` may be added. But for now it is omitted.
