This file is for tracking features that are less well implemented or less powerful than their `git` counterparts for one reason or another.

#### `git-repository`

##### RevSpec parsing

- cannot disambiguate trees using blob-access syntax like `000000:blob`
    - See [this test](https://github.com/Byron/gitoxide/blob/5278cbc9b91ce01761a96a6962564a92daa77b7f/git-repository/tests/rev_spec/mod.rs#L102).
- cannot disambiguate objects using their **object type** like `000000^{blob}`
    - See [this test](https://github.com/Byron/gitoxide/blob/9d2e1eb3defc3ddd7ade7fe2bdd26d8a21afe55f/git-repository/tests/rev_spec/mod.rs#L83) 
      which mentions the current behaviour.
    - There are more tests around the same behaviour, check for `parse_spec_no_baseline(â€¦)` to see where we fall short. Note that git can't disambiguate
      consistently either, so eventually I would expect to get ahead.

### git-protocol
* **fetches using protocol V1 and stateful connections, i.e. ssh, git, file, may hang**
    * This can be fixed by making response parsing.
    * Note that this does not affect cloning, which works fine.

### `git-pack`
* **Packfiles use memory maps**
    * Even though they are comfortable to use and fast, they squelch IO errors.
    * _potential remedy_: We could generalize the Pack to make it possible to work on in-memory buffers directly. That way, one
      would initialize a Pack by reading the whole file into memory, thus not squelching IO errors at the expense of latency as well
      as memory efficiency.
* **Packfiles cannot load files bigger than 2^31 or 2^32 on 32 bit systems**
    * As these systems cannot address more memory than that.
    * _potential remedy_: implement a sliding window to map and unmap portions of the file as needed.
        * However, those who need to access big packs on these systems would rather resort to `git` itself, allowing
          our implementation to be simpler and potentially more performant.
* **Objects larger than 32 bits cannot be loaded on 32 bit systems**
    * in-memory representations objects cannot handle objects greater than the amount of addressable memory.
    * This will not affect git LFS though.

### `git-url`

* **git-url** _might_ be more restrictive than what git allows as for the most part, it uses a browser grade URL parser.
    * Thus far there is no proof for this, and as _potential remedy_ we could certainly re-implement exactly what git does
      to handle its URLs.

### `git-features`

* **local time** is currently impeded by [this issue](https://github.com/time-rs/time/issues/293#issuecomment-909158529) but it's planned to resolve it eventually.
