//! Git stores all of its data as _Objects_, which are data along with a hash over all data. Storing objects efficiently
//! is what git packs are concerned about.
//!
//! Packs consist of [data files][data::File] and [index files][index::File]. The latter can be generated from a data file
//! and make accessing objects within a pack feasible.
//!
//! A [Bundle] conveniently combines a data pack alongside its index to allow [finding][Find] objects or verifying the pack.
//! Objects returned by `.find(â€¦)` are [objects][git_object::Data] which know their pack location in order to speed up
//! various common operations like creating new packs from existing ones.
//!
//! When traversing all objects in a pack, a _delta tree acceleration structure_ can be built from pack data or an index
//! in order to decompress packs in parallel and without any waste.
