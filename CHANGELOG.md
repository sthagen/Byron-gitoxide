### Commit Details

<details><summary>view details</summary>

 * **[#298](https://github.com/Byron/gitoxide/issues/298)**
    - Use all tags by default, instead of requiring annotated tags ([`00c42ca`](https://github.com/Byron/gitoxide/commit/00c42ca36e93a22f233fc1d3f9a1afc241fd4464))
    - support for the --max-candidates flag ([`b9e6754`](https://github.com/Byron/gitoxide/commit/b9e67540801f2630be8aa1acbfddfec4202360ac))
    - Reduce amount of max candidates, add --debug flag ([`c8c13e3`](https://github.com/Byron/gitoxide/commit/c8c13e398671a21e96282547fc0e3bd445627e2f))
    - Add `gix repo commit describe` ([`7e99e6a`](https://github.com/Byron/gitoxide/commit/7e99e6aeee9bf200a561d215c586301f5e4a8cbc))

</details>

## 0.11.0 (2022-04-03)

<csr-id-4d2d433e7e98ac42db858688edac06e68ee4d10d/>

Adapt to changes in `git-features` which change `Send + Sync` to `Send + Clone`. This happens to allow non-sync implementations (i.e. thread-local), along with `Sync` ones
which usually are `Clone` too as they are passed by immutable reference (which is `Clone + Copy`).

### Refactor (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-4d2d433e7e98ac42db858688edac06e68ee4d10d/> Remove light* features, add 'lean-async' in its place; remove termion support

### Changed (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-bf04644ab75ed1969507f957dc8d4868790d462d/> remove `Option<impl Progress>` in favor of `impl Progress`
 - <csr-id-d851bede97801096d188ff6af06c98a79fe276db/> remove unnecessary `Arc` around `should_interrupt` flag
 - <csr-id-c2679a03358b9c19d63ed1af1cd57324c6381447/> remove Sha1 mentions in `index::verify::Mode::*` variants
   The hash is repository defined and not hard-coded
 - <csr-id-51bf03feaa94bebb26690dff92262b2134070a44/> Remove lean plumbing CLI

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-57ca0456cf02073099bfd403f9155290af756ecd/> Collect all stdout messages in line renderer as well
   Otherwise the threaded line renderer will interfere with genuine
   program output.

### New Features

 - <csr-id-384ed665c7423feca1b1ee1f81db10867fa813a8/> `gix mailmap verify` command
 - <csr-id-70109bee679d33a5c5fb3a78a708b479684b03b1/> `ein find --debug` to learn why it is slow
 - <csr-id-00909619ff04e247aabc9ffe3c025f0064c3092d/> --counting-threads flag to configure amount of threads when counting
   The efficiency of multi-threaded counting is low per core, and despite
   some speedups might be desirable, one might not want to commit all cores
   to this amount of waste.
 - <csr-id-25da30f3652bd72c157e84439dd6e3957471fa08/> in-manifest and in-bin documentation of feature toggles
   Unfortunately, these don't show up on docs.rs due to it being a abinary
   only crate. One could consider throwing in a lib just for good measure.

## v0.10.0 (2021-10-20)

This release pins beta versions of `clap` to avoid it to automatically fetch the latest one
during installation.

This is made possible due to `clap` itself pinning its dependency
to the `clap-derive` crate.

## v0.9.0 (2021-10-15)

A first usable version of `git-repository` to make using `gitoxide` from your applications so much easier. It serves as a one-stop shop for application developers without sacrificing performance by default while making common use-cases more convenient.

### Feature list

* `git-repository` as hub crate for application development with focus on usability without sacrificing any knob to tune performance.
* opt-in `async` for `git-packetline`, `git-transport` and `git-protocol` for fully async git clients, along with the `light-async` feature toggle to build a `gix pack-receive` with an async client instead of a blocking one.
* Statistics for `gix pack-create` with the `-s/--statistics` flag to have data indicating the cost of the operation. Currently it's doing a lot of work that has to be avoided in order to be useable in production and the numbers underline that. Future iterations will cause key metrics to go down.
* Packs are now reproducible by default, which means that the same tip will always generate a pack with the same hash. This may be a desirable property for some kinds of packs, but not for others which is why it can be turned off for a considerable speed boost.
* `git-tempfile` crate
* `git-lock` crate
* `git-ref` crate with complete loose-ref, packed-ref and transaction support.


### Performance

* On M1, thanks to [a new release](https://github.com/RustCrypto/hashes/pull/289#event-5035369215), Sha1 is now computed much faster which unlocks a massive performance boost. In my test, verifying/decoding the entire linux kernel pack now happens in 17s, as compared to 37s for canonical `git`.
* `git-object` parsing is a few percent faster thanks a reworked error handling for objects. By default, error collection is disabled entirely making the error case zero-sized. If needed, verbose and stacked errors can be turned on using a feature toggle for applications who expect repositories with malformed objects and need detailed diagnostics.

### New Features

 - <csr-id-60c9fad8002b4e3f6b9607bba6361871752f4d3d/> control pack and object cache size in megabytes in some sub-commands

### Thanks Clippy

<csr-read-only-do-not-edit/>

[Clippy](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy) helped 3 times to make code idiomatic. 

## v0.6.0 (2020-12-16)

Maintenance release without any new features.

These are created to account for breaking changes within the dependency graph of
`gitoxide` crates. Due to some blunders in the past the version on crates.io
could not be installed anymore.
This was eventually fixed with new minor releases across the ecosystem.

Finally, yet another breaking change due to the introduction of the `git-hash`
crate to break a dependency cycle between `git-object` and `git-features` caused
yet another maintenance release.

## v0.5.0 (2020-12-15)

Maintenance release without any new features.
