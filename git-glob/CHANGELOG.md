## 0.3.0 (2022-05-18)

### New Features

 - <csr-id-455a72eb0c01c158f43d9b9a1180886f677bad00/> `fmt::Display` impl for `Pattern`.
   This way the original pattern can be reproduced on the fly without
   actually storing it, saving one allocation.
 - <csr-id-2c88b575630e1b179955dad578e779aad8dd58d8/> add `Default` impl for `pattern::Case`

### Changed (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-8fd9f24e2f751292a99b4f92cc47df67e17ab537/> invert meaning of `wildcard::Mode::SLASH_IS_LITERAL`
   This is done by renaming it to
 - <csr-id-f76a426833530c7a7e787487cfceaba2c80b21ac/> remove `base_path` field from `Pattern`
   It's now passed as argument to the path pattern matcher and maybe
   it will even be removed one day.
   
   Even though it's convenient to have a base path per pattern, it's
   quite some duplication.
 - <csr-id-568f013e762423fc54a8fb1daed1e7b59c1dc0f0/> `Pattern::matches()` is now private
   It doesn't work as one would expect due to it wanting to match relative
   paths only. Thus it's better to spare folks the surprise and instead
   use `wildmatch()` directly. It works the same, but doesn't
   have certain shortcuts which aren't needed for standard matches
   anyway.

## 0.2.0 (2022-04-13)

### Changed (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-6ce3611891d4b60c86055bf749a1b4060ee2c3e1/> `parse()` returns a `Pattern`.
   This is much more ergonomic as this is the only things we are ever
   interested in for matching. If necessary, from there one can also
   use the parts individually or alter them.

## 0.1.0 (2022-04-07)

Initial release with pattern parsing functionality.

### Changed (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-568f013e762423fc54a8fb1daed1e7b59c1dc0f0/> `Pattern::matches()` is now private
   It doesn't work as one would expect due to it wanting to match relative
   paths only. Thus it's better to spare folks the surprise and instead
   use `wildmatch()` directly. It works the same, but doesn't
   have certain shortcuts which aren't needed for standard matches
   anyway.

### New Features

 - <csr-id-2c88b575630e1b179955dad578e779aad8dd58d8/> add `Default` impl for `pattern::Case`

### Commit Statistics
