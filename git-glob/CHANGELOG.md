## 0.2.0 (2022-04-13)

### Changed (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-6ce3611891d4b60c86055bf749a1b4060ee2c3e1/> `parse()` returns a `Pattern`.
   This is much more ergonomic as this is the only things we are ever
   interested in for matching. If necessary, from there one can also
   use the parts individually or alter them.
