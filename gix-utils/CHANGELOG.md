## 0.2.0 (2025-04-04)

### Bug Fixes (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-d737c4a6856c01a54c3ec1eea9ee4b70d76f67ab/> Rename `Exponential` backoff to `Quadratic`
   The `gix_utils::backoff::Exponential` type actually implemented
   quadratic, not exponential, backoff. This renames it from
   `Exponential` to `Quadratic`.
   
   In exponential backoff, delays are a fixed base, often 2, raised to
   a power of a number that increases by one with each attempt. When
   the number that increases by one with each attempt is the base,
   raised to a fixed power, that is quadratic backoff.
   
   The intended behavior here was quadratic, as implemented. For
   example, in the tests, `EXPECTED_TILL_SECOND` lists the values 1,
   4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100, and so on, which are ascending
   squares. If they were an exponential sequence, then they would look
   like 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, and so on.
   
   Thus, it is only the named that needed to be changed: the
   implementation was already as intended.

## 0.1.13 (2024-10-22)

<csr-id-64ff0a77062d35add1a2dd422bb61075647d1a36/>

### Other

 - <csr-id-64ff0a77062d35add1a2dd422bb61075647d1a36/> Update gitoxide repository URLs
   This updates `Byron/gitoxide` URLs to `GitoxideLabs/gitoxide` in:
   
   - Markdown documentation, except changelogs and other such files
     where such changes should not be made.
   
   - Documentation comments (in .rs files).
   
   - Manifest (.toml) files, for the value of the `repository` key.
   
   - The comments appearing at the top of a sample hook that contains
     a repository URL as an example.
   
   When making these changes, I also allowed my editor to remove
   trailing whitespace in any lines in files already being edited
   (since, in this case, there was no disadvantage to allowing this).
   
   The gitoxide repository URL changed when the repository was moved
   into the recently created GitHub organization `GitoxideLabs`, as
   detailed in #1406. Please note that, although I believe updating
   the URLs to their new canonical values is useful, this is not
   needed to fix any broken links, since `Byron/gitoxide` URLs
   redirect (and hopefully will always redirect) to the coresponding
   `GitoxideLabs/gitoxide` URLs.
   
   While this change should not break any URLs, some affected URLs
   were already broken. This updates them, but they are still broken.
   They will be fixed in a subsequent commit.
   
   This also does not update `Byron/gitoxide` URLs in test fixtures
   or test cases, nor in the `Makefile`. (It may make sense to change
   some of those too, but it is not really a documentation change.)

## 0.1.8 (2023-12-30)

<csr-id-3bd09ef120945a9669321ea856db4079a5dab930/>

### Chore

- <csr-id-3bd09ef120945a9669321ea856db4079a5dab930/> change `rust-version` manifest field back to 1.65.
  They didn't actually need to be higher to work, and changing them
  unecessarily can break downstream CI.

  Let's keep this value as low as possible, and only increase it when
  more recent features are actually used.

   and to implement conversion pipelines which conditionally
   transform an input over multiple steps.

## 0.1.0 (2023-04-19)

### New Features (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-b83ee366a3c65c717beb587ad809268f1c54b8ad/> Rename `serde1` cargo feature to `serde` and use the weak-deps cargo capability.
   With it it's possible to not automatically declare all optional dependencies externally visible
   features, and thus re-use feature names that oterwise are also a crate name.
   
   Previously I thought that `serde1` is for future-proofing and supporting multiple serde versions
   at the same time. However, it's most definitely a burden I wouldn't want anyway, so using
   `serde` seems to be the way to go into the future.
