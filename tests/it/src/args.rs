    /// changed a file in its history.

    /// With respect to branches and merge commits, the **blame history** will not necessarily be
    /// identical to the file's history in the source repository. This is because the blame
    /// algorithm will stop following a file's history for branches that only touch lines for which
    /// the source has already been found. The **blame history**, thus, looks likely "cleaner" and
