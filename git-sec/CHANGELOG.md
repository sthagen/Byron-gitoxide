## 0.1.0 (2022-05-18)

### New Features

 - <csr-id-95577e20d5e62cb6043d32f6a7b9023d827b9ce4/> A shared `permission::Error` type
 - <csr-id-de0226ab863f3d5d6688f1b89aa3ebc9bfdf1f34/> `permission::Error`
   A lightweight, general purpose error to display permissions violations
   that cause errors. This should make it useable across crates.
 - <csr-id-f6077978fd5697bd113a894ba68492213becea41/> obtain identities `from_path()` or `from_process()`
 - <csr-id-cdf3c3e42433a85e8b47b9dc5558f5c76df3c6ae/> add `Identity` type

### Changed (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-f00f4a4a3a9149bf5cf925e931a8105aeb9b9db9/> simplify `Permission` type radically `
 - <csr-id-37a607db7c09ab897f306e3bbd4e0ca4e4387bae/> remove `Identity` in favor of `identity::Account` module; add `identity::UserId`
   As the fewest consumers will be able to deal with multiple identities,
   remove the enumeration approach in favor of individual type which deal
   with one specific way of identifying a user.
