# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please feel free to [draft a GitHub advisory](https://github.com/Byron/gitoxide/security/advisories/new), and I will work with you to disclose and or resolve the issue
responsibly.

If this doesn't seem like the right approach or there are questions, please feel free to reach out to the @icloud.com email used in my commits. 

Thank you.
