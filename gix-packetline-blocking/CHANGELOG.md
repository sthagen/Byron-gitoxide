## 0.18.0 (2024-10-22)

<csr-id-64ff0a77062d35add1a2dd422bb61075647d1a36/>

### Other

 - <csr-id-64ff0a77062d35add1a2dd422bb61075647d1a36/> Update gitoxide repository URLs
   This updates `Byron/gitoxide` URLs to `GitoxideLabs/gitoxide` in:
   
   - Markdown documentation, except changelogs and other such files
     where such changes should not be made.
   
   - Documentation comments (in .rs files).
   
   - Manifest (.toml) files, for the value of the `repository` key.
   
   - The comments appearing at the top of a sample hook that contains
     a repository URL as an example.
   
   When making these changes, I also allowed my editor to remove
   trailing whitespace in any lines in files already being edited
   (since, in this case, there was no disadvantage to allowing this).
   
   The gitoxide repository URL changed when the repository was moved
   into the recently created GitHub organization `GitoxideLabs`, as
   detailed in #1406. Please note that, although I believe updating
   the URLs to their new canonical values is useful, this is not
   needed to fix any broken links, since `Byron/gitoxide` URLs
   redirect (and hopefully will always redirect) to the coresponding
   `GitoxideLabs/gitoxide` URLs.
   
   While this change should not break any URLs, some affected URLs
   were already broken. This updates them, but they are still broken.
   They will be fixed in a subsequent commit.
   
   This also does not update `Byron/gitoxide` URLs in test fixtures
   or test cases, nor in the `Makefile`. (It may make sense to change
   some of those too, but it is not really a documentation change.)

### Bug Fixes (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-17573779688e755a786546d5e42ab533088cd726/> remove all workspace dependencies
   The problem is that with them, we don't notice anymore if the crate changes,
   because a dependency changes. That also means that older versions of the dependency
   may stay even though some other crates might pick up a newer version.
   
   Ultimately, this will lead to drift and subtle incompatibilities.
   
   We declare this breaking to enforce a proper re-release.

   They didn't actually need to be higher to work, and changing them
   unecessarily can break downstream CI.
   
   Let's keep this value as low as possible, and only increase it when
   more recent features are actually used.

## 0.17.0 (2023-12-06)

### New Features (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-c3edef1c0c49accbb037bdf086dade3ed0e5e507/> make it possible to trace incoming and outgoing packetlines.
   Due to the way this is (and has to be) setup, unfortunately one
   has to integrate that with two crates, instead of just one.
   
   This changes touches multiple crates, most of which receive a single
   boolean as last argument to indicate whether the tracing should
   happen in the first place.

<csr-id-145125ab79526a6191a9192a6faa7fe1a8826935/>

### Chore

 - <csr-id-145125ab79526a6191a9192a6faa7fe1a8826935/> use `faster-hex` instead of `hex`
   The performance here certainly doesn't make a difference, but we
   try to avoid duplicate dependencies.
