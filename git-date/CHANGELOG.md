## 0.0.2 (2022-07-22)

### New Features

 - <csr-id-c76fde7de278b49ded13b655d5345e4eb8c1b134/> initialize `Time` from `now_utc` and `now_local`
   Localtime support depends on some other factors now, but that
   will only get better over time.
   
   We might have to document `unsound_local_time` at some point.
 - <csr-id-aeda76ed500d2edba62747d667227f2664edd267/> `Time::is_set()` to see if the time is more than just the default.
